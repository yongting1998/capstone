To Prof Sye Loong.

Please go to branch syeloong.

please install dependencies in requirements.txt
please run api/predict_with_fixed_data.py

please note that this uses fixed date, as it is retrieving data from full_tooSlow.csv instead of live-data.
However, it is using the current time.

if you want to use a pre-defined time. please take a look at line 28 and line 61 for example. (hour = 14)

you will find the front-end here. https://capstone-five-nu.vercel.app/

I hope this is sufficient. Thank you.
